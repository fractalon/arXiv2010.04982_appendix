# Appendix to arXiv:2010.04982 paper "On the stochasticity parameter of quadratic residues" (M. R. Gabdullin)

We calculate list of interest values of $A$ (see remarks after theorem 1.3 in paper and file "README.pdf" for details) and make graphics of his distribution among natural numbers and prime numbers.

We use Python 3.7 and matplotlib.

Script `run.py` save results to `output` folder. You can change constant `END_VALUE` in code for change bound of calculation.

See `precalculated` folder for precalculated graphics with big numbers.

# Results
